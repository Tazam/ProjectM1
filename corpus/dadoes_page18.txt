I wonder if I'm late for work, Isidore wondered as he scraped. He did not own a working
clock; generally he depended on the TV for time signals, but today was Interspace
Horizons Day, evidently. Anyhow the TV claimed this to be the fifth (or sixth?)
anniversary of the founding of New America, the chief U.S. settlement on Mars. And his
TV set, being partly broken, picked up only the channel which had been nationalized
during the war and still remained so; the government in Washington, with its
colonization program, constituted the sole sponsor which Isidore found himself forced to
listen to.
"Let's hear from Mrs. Maggie Klugman," the TV announcer suggested to John Isidore,
who wanted only to know the time. "A recent immigrant to Mars, Mrs. Klugman in an
interview taped live in New New York had this to say. Mrs. Klugman, how would you
contrast your life back on contaminated Earth with your new life here in a world rich
with every imaginable possibility?" A pause, and then a tired, dry, middle-aged, female
voice said, "I think what I and my family of three noticed most was the dignity." "The
dignity, Mrs. Klugman? " the announcer asked. "Yes," Mrs. Klugman, now of New New
York, Mars, said. "It's a hard thing to explain. Having a servant you can depend on in
these troubled times ... I find it reassuring."
"Back on Earth, Mrs. Klugman, in the old days, did you also worry about finding
yourself classified, ahem, as a special?"
"Oh, my husband and myself worried ourselves nearly to death. Of course, once we
emigrated that worry vanished, fortunately forever."
To himself John Isidore thought acidly, And it's gone away for me, too, without my
having to emigrate. He had been a special now for over a year, and not merely in regard
to the distorted genes which he carried.
