In the depression caused by the sagging of the floor, pieces of animals manifested
themselves, the head of a crow, mummified hands which might have once been parts of
monkeys. A donkey stood a little way off, not stirring and yet apparently alive; at least it
had not begun to deteriorate. He started toward it, feeling stick-like bones, dry as weeds,
splinter under his shoes. But before he could reach the donkey-one of the creatures
which he loved the most-a shiny blue crow fell from above to perch on the donkey's
unprotesting muzzle. Don't, he said aloud, but the crow, rapidly, picked out the donkey's
eyes. Again, he thought. It's happening to me again. I will be down here a long time, he
realized. As before. It's always long, because nothing here ever changes; a point comes
when it does not even decay.
A dry wind rustled, and around him the heaps of bones broke. Even the wind destroys
them, he perceived. At this stage. Just before time ceases. I wish I could remember how
to climb up from here, he thought. Looking up he saw nothing to grasp.
Mercer, he said aloud. Where are you now? This is the tomb world and I am in it again,
but this time you're not here too.
Something crept across his foot. He knelt down and searched for it-and found it because
it moved so slowly. The mutilated spider, advancing itself haltingly on its surviving legs;
he picked it up and held it in the palm of his hand. The bones , he realized, have reversed
themselves ; the spider is again alive. Mercer must be near.
The wind blew, cracking and splintering the remaining bones, but he sensed the presence
of Mercer. Come here, he said to Mercer. Crawl across my foot or find some other way
of reaching me. Okay? Mercer, he thought. Aloud he said, "Mercer!"
