Coraline’s father was home. Both of her parents worked, doing things on computers, which meant that they were home a lot of the time. Each of them had their own study.
“Hello Coraline,” he said when she came in, without turning round.
“Mmph,” said Coraline. “It’s raining.”
“Yup,” said her father. “It’s bucketing down.”
“No,” said Coraline. “It’s just raining. Can I go outside?”
“What does your mother say?”
“She says you’re not going out in weather like that, Coraline Jones.” “Then, no.”
“But I want to carry on exploring.”
“Then explore the flat,” suggested her father. “Look—here’s a piece of paper and a pen. Count all the doors and windows. List everything blue. Mount an expedition to discover the hot water tank. And leave me alone to work.”
“Can I go into the drawing room?” The drawing room was where the Joneses kept the expensive (and uncomfortable) furniture Coraline’s grandmother had left them when she died. Coraline wasn’t allowed in there. Nobody went in there. It was only for best.
“If you don’t make a mess. And you don’t touch anything.”
Coraline considered this carefully, then she took the paper and pen and went off to explore the inside of the flat.
