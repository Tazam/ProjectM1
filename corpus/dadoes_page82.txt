I think I would like to
try a false animal, and if it didn’t work then you could find
us a real cat to replace Horace. 1 just don’t want my hus¬
band to know; I don’t think he could live through it. That’s
why he never got close to Horace; he was afraid to. And
when Horace got sick—with pneumonitis, as you tell me—
Ed got panic-stricken and just wouldn’t face it. That’s why
we waited so long to call you. Too long ... as I knew be¬
fore you called. 1 knew.” She nodded, her tears under con¬
trol now. “How long will it take?”
Milt essayed, “We can have it ready in ten days. We’ll
deliver it during the day while your husband is at work.”
He wound up the call, said good-bye, and hung up. “He’ll
know,” he said to Mr. Sloat. “In five seconds. But that’s
what she wants.”
“Owners who get to love their animals,” Sloat said
somberly, “go to pieces. I’m glad we’re not usually in¬
volved with real animals. You realize that actual animal
vets have to make calls like that all the time?” He contem¬
plated John Isidore. “In some ways you’re not so stupid af¬
ter all, Isidore. You handled that reasonably well. Even
though Milt had to come in and take over.”
“He was doing fine,” Milt said. “God, that was tough.”
He picked up the dead Horace. “I’ll take this down to the
shop; Han, you phone Wheelright & Carpenter and get
their builder over to measure and photograph it. I’m not
going to let them take it to their shop; I want to compare
the replica myself.”
“I think I’ll have Isidore talk to them,” Mr. Sloat de¬
cided. “He got this started; he ought to be able to deal with
Wheelright & Carpenter after handling Mrs. Pilsen.”
