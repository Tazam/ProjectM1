I think I would like to try a
false animal, and if it didn't work then you could find us a real cat to replace Horace. I
just don't want my husband to know; I don't think he could live through it. That's why he
never got close to Horace; he was afraid to. And when Horace got sick-with
pneumonitis, as you tell me Ed got panic-stricken and just wouldn't face it. That's why
we waited so long to call you. Too long ... as I knew before you called. I knew." She
nodded, her tears under control, now. "How long will it take?"
Milt essayed, "We can have it ready in ten days. "We'll deliver it during the day while
your husband is at work." He wound up the call, said good-by, and hung up. "He'll
know," he said to Mr. Sloat. "In five seconds. But that's what she wants."
"Owners who get to love their animals," Sloat said somberly, "go to pieces. I'm glad
we're not usually involved with real animals. You realize that actual animal vets have to
make calls like that all the time?" He contemplated John Isidore. "In some ways you're
not so stupid after all, Isidore. You handled that reasonably well. Even though Milt had
to come in and take over."
"He was doing fine," Milt said. "God, that was tough." He picked up the dead Horace.
"I'll take this down to the shop; Han, you phone Wheelright & Carpenter and get their
builder over to measure and photograph it. I'm not going to let them take it to their shop;
I want to compare the replica myself."
"I think I'll have Isidore talk to them," Mr. Sloat decided. "He got this started; he ought
to be able to deal with Wheelright & Carpenter after handling Mrs. Pilsen."
