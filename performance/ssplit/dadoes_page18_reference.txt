Perhaps, deformed as it was, Earth remained familiar, to be clung to.
Or possibly the non-emigrant imagined that the tent of dust would deplete itself finally.
In any case thousands of individuals remained, most of them constellated in urban areas where they could physically see one another, take heart at their mutual presence.
Those appeared to be the relatively sane ones.
And, in dubious addition to them, occasional peculiar entities remained in the virtually abandoned suburbs.
John Isidore, being yammered at by the television set in his living room as he shaved in the bathroom, was one of these.
He simply had wandered to this spot in the early days following the war.
In those evil times no one had known, really, what they were doing.
Populations, detached by the war, had roamed, squatted temporarily at first one region and then another.
Back then the fallout had been sporadic and highly variable; some states had been nearly free of it, others became saturated.
The displaced populations moved as the dust moved.
The peninsula south of San Francisco had been at first dust-free, and a great body of persons had responded by taking up residence there; when the dust arrived, some had died and the rest had departed.
J. R. Isidore remained.
The TV set shouted, "-duplicates the halcyon days of the pre-Civil War Southern states!
Either as body servants or tireless field hands, the custom-tailored humanoid robot designed specifically for YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS, FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE given to you on your arrival absolutely free, equipped fully, as specified by you before your departure from Earth; this loyal, trouble-free companion in the greatest, boldest adventure contrived by man in modern history will provide-" It continued on and on.
